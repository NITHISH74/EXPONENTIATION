# Find the exponentiation of a number

## AIM:
To write a program to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Get the input from the user.
2. Use exponentiation operator to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Program:
#Program to to find the Exponentiation of a number.
#Developed by: NITHISHWAR S 
#RegisterNumber: 21002766 

x=int(input())

def exp():
    
    exp=x**2
    
    return exp
    
print("Exponentiation of a given number:",exp())

## Output:
